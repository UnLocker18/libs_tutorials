# Libs tutorials

In this repository you'll find a couple of tutorials explaining how to use some C++ libraries inside a GLUT based project.

- [ImGui](tutorials/ImGui-tutorial.md)
- [ReactPhysics3D](tutorials/ReactPhysics3D-tutorial.md)

Inside the folder [reactphysics3d-build/debug-win32](reactphysics3d-build/debug-win32) there's a compiled version of ReactPhysics3D (mode Debug, platform Win32), if you don't need the latest version you can use that inside your project. More about how to do it in the ReactPhysics3D tutorial.

These were made for a computer graphics course at Politecnico di Torino.
